# X Clone

This is a clone of the popular X (formerly known as Twitter) website, built using HTML and Tailwind CSS. The project showcases my skills in modern web design and development, particularly with the use of Tailwind CSS for building responsive, clean, and minimalistic UI components.

## Features

- **Responsive Design**: The layout adapts to different screen sizes, making it mobile-friendly.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utilizes Tailwind's utility-first classes for fast styling and customization.
- **Basic UI Components**: Includes headers, footers, profile sections, and tweet-like card components.
- **Modern Design**: The design mimics X's aesthetic with a focus on simplicity and usability.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: For the basic structure of the webpage.
- **Tailwind CSS**: For styling and layout.
- **JavaScript (optional)**: For any interactive elements (if applicable).
